Algorithms , complexity logN
this code gets the minimum and maximun side of x points and y points and that waht dfine the shape of polygon
so there is a function " get max" and functon " get minimum " 
it can be only one function for minimum and maximum , but i choosed to make it aliile bit simpler
i have a struct which containx ,y points 
and the points are saved in 1D array of struct ,and that array send to my function BoundingBoxOfConvexPolygon
and the functions depend on binary search idea to reach to smallest and largest by specifiying that in simple conditions
